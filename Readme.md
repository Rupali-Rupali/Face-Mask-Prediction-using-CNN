# Face Mask Prediction using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to predict whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image. The model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract features from images and make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from Kaggle and consists of labeled images of people's faces with and without masks. To access the dataset in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Install the Kaggle library:
    ```bash
    !pip install kaggle
    ```
2. Upload your Kaggle API token (`kaggle.json`) to your Google Drive.
3. Mount Google Drive in the notebook:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```
4. Copy the Kaggle API token to the appropriate location:
    ```bash
    !mkdir ~/.kaggle
    !cp /content/drive/MyDrive/path/to/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
    !chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
    ```
5. Download the dataset using the Kaggle API:
    ```bash
    !kaggle datasets download -d username/dataset-name -p /content/dataset/
    ```
6. Extract the dataset:
    ```bash
    !unzip /content/dataset/dataset-name.zip -d /content/dataset/
    ```
7. Load and preprocess the dataset:
    - Use appropriate data loading and preprocessing techniques, such as data augmentation and normalization.

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract spatial features from the input images. Dropout layers are employed to reduce overfitting, and the final output layer utilizes a softmax activation function to classify images into the two classes (with mask or without mask).

## Usage in Google Colab
1. Build and train the CNN model:
    - Implement the model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras.
    - Train the model on the training data.
    - 
2. Evaluate the trained model:
    - Test the model's performance on a separate test set.
3. Make predictions:
    - Utilize the trained model to make predictions on new images.

## Results
- Provide details on the performance metrics of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on the test set.
- Include visualizations of the model's performance, such as confusion matrices and ROC curves.
